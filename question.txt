Exercise:

    The candidate is asked to write, in the main() function, the C code
    necessary to retrieve and print to stdout the current year by using the
    devices provided by the platform (QEMU's virt model).  The minimal
    libraries already included have to be enough to complete the test.
    The README includes enough information to compile the sources.

    The solution has to be a GIT patch that applies correctly to the provided
    source code.
